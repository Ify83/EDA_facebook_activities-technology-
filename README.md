Social media has transformed how individuals share their lives, interact with
others, and express themselves. For many, platforms like Facebook have
served as digital diaries, spaces for social interaction, and outlets for sharing
personal milestones, opinions, and content. This project focuses on a detailed
analysis of personal Facebook post data over the past decade (2014-2024) to
uncover trends, patterns, and insights that reflect changes in engagement,
activity levels, and possibly underlying shifts in life events or interests.
OBJECTIVES
This analysis will explore various aspects of Facebook post activity, such as:
Temporal Trends: Examine how the volume of posts varies over the
years, with attention to fluctuations, peaks, and declines. This can reflect
changes in platform usage patterns, engagement with online
communities, and personal sharing habits.
1.
Seasonality: Identify recurring patterns or cycles within the data. Certain
times of the year, such as holidays, birthdays, or significant public
events, might prompt increased activity.
2.
Growth and Engagement Analysis: Determine if there is a noticeable
growth or decline in post frequency over the years. Insights could reveal
periods of heightened engagement and points of change, possibly
aligned with life stages, professional shifts, or changes in interest levels.
3.
4.Anomalies and Outliers: Investigate periods of unusually high or low
activity, which may correspond to unique events, lifestyle changes, or shifts
in platform interaction style.
5. Impact of External Events: Contextualize spikes or drops in activity in light
of major external factors. World events, policy changes in the platform, or
new social media trends could influence how and when posts were made.
